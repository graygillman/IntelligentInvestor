# Investment Strategy Guidelines

## Strategy and Approach

- **1. Diversification**: Aim for 10 to 30 investments. Index funds are recommended.
- **2. Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Invest fixed amounts regularly.
- **3. Barbell Strategy**: Keep 90% in safe investments, 10% in speculative.
- **4. Undervalued Opportunities**: Seek overlooked or undervalued companies.

## Company Evaluation Criteria

- **5. Company Size**: Prefer market cap over $2 billion.
- **6. Financial Health**: Seek a current ratio of 2:1.
- **7. Dividend History**: Look for 10 to 20 years of continuous payments.
- **8. Earnings Stability**: No deficits in the past 10 years.
- **9. Earnings Growth**: At least one-third growth in per-share earnings over ten years.
- **10. Institutional Ownership**: Caution if over 60%.
- **11. Long-term Debt**: Should not exceed 50% of total capital, prefer fixed rate.
- **12. Owner Earnings**: Focus on the company's true cash generation.

## Valuation and Pricing

- **13. Valuation Metrics**: Price no more than 1.5 times net asset value. Reasonable P/E ratio.
- **14. Bargain Prices**: Below net working-capital value.
- **15. Earnings Multiples**: Don't overpay based on earnings multiples.
- **16. Growth Stock Valuation**: `Value = Current Earnings X (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate)`.

## Diligent Research

### Research and Analysis

- **17. Research and Analysis**: Review 5 years of annual and the latest quarterly reports.
- **18. Management Quality**: Assess management incentives, policies, and stock activities.
- **19. Reading Reports**: Read thoroughly, especially footnotes.

### Guidelines for Reviewing Company Reports

- Investigate the company's growth and profit sources.
- Consider acquisition habits and dependency on debt or single customers.
- Evaluate the competitive advantage and growth over the past decade.
- Review R&D spending and check for non-recurring financial statement items.
- Assess the management's long-term vision and alignment with shareholders.

## Financial Ratios and Metrics

- Calculate earnings to fixed charges ratio.
- **20. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: `ROIC = Owner Earnings / Invested Capital`.
- Assess investment efficiency and ensure a steady growth in owner earnings per share.
- ROIC above 10% is attractive; 6-7% can be considered.

Maintaining a disciplined investment strategy is crucial for success. Regularly review these guidelines to adjust your portfolio as needed for optimal performance.
