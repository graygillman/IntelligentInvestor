# Investment Strategy Guidelines

## Summary Points
1. **Diversification**: Aim to have a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 30 different investments. Index funds are recommended for easy diversification.
2. **Company Size**: Prefer companies with a market capitalization greater than $2 billion. This suggests a level of established operations and potential stability.
3. **Financial Health**: Look for a strong financial condition in companies, indicated by a current ratio of 2:1, meaning they have twice as many current assets as current liabilities.
4. **Dividend History**: Companies should have a history of continuous dividend payments for at least 10 years, with 20 years being preferable.
5. **Earnings Stability**: There should be no earnings deficits in the past 10 years.
6. **Earnings Growth**: Seek a ten-year growth in per-share earnings of at least one-third.
7. **Valuation Metrics**: The price of stock should be no more than 1.5 times the net asset value. The price-to-book ratio should be less than 1.5, and the P/E ratio should be reasonable.
8. **Institutional Ownership**: Be cautious with stocks where institutional ownership is greater than 60%, as this can often lead to higher volatility.
9. **Bargain Prices**: Consider stocks that trade below their net working-capital value.
10. **Earnings Multiples**: Avoid paying more than 25 times the average of the last 7 years' earnings, 15 times the average of the last 3 years' earnings, or 20 times the earnings of the last 12 months.
11. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Implement a strategy of investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of stock price fluctuations.
12. **Barbell Strategy**: Maintain a portfolio with 90% in safe investments and 10% in speculative opportunities.
13. **Undervalued Opportunities**: Search for overlooked and undervalued companies that may offer good investment opportunities.
14. **Growth Stock Valuation**: Use the formula `Value = Current Earnings X (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate)` to evaluate growth stocks.
15. **Research and Analysis**: Diligently review and analyze 5 years of a company's annual reports and the latest quarterly reports.
16. **Management Quality**: Assess the company's management quality, including their performance incentives, remuneration policies, and whether they own and are buying or selling company stock.
17. **Long-term Debt**: Ensure that long-term debt does not exceed 50% of total capital and that it is at a fixed rate rather than variable.
18. **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: Calculate ROIC and compare it against industry benchmarks.
19. **Owner Earnings**: Consider owner earnings as a true measure of a company's cash generation capability.
20. **Reading Reports**: Always read company reports thoroughly, starting from the back and paying special attention to the footnotes.

## Guidelines for Reviewing Company Reports
- Investigate the source of the company's growth and profits.
- Consider if the company frequently acquires other companies.
- Determine if the company relies heavily on debt or if it depends on a single customer for a large portion of its revenue.
- Check if the company has a competitive advantage or "moat".
- Analyze the company's growth over the past 10 years.
- Review the company's R&D expenditure compared to the industry average.
- Check for non-recurring items in the financial statements, as they can indicate underlying issues.
- Evaluate the management's long-term vision and their alignment with shareholder interests.

## Financial Ratios and Metrics
- Calculate the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.
- Use the formula `ROIC = Owner Earnings / Invested Capital` to assess investment efficiency.
- Owner earnings should account for all normal business expenses and adjustments.
- Invested capital should exclude non-operational assets like excess cash and consider past accounting charges.
- A steady growth in owner earnings per share indicates a strong, cash-generating business.
- ROIC figures above 10% are attractive, and even 6-7% can be considered for investment.

It is important to maintain a disciplined approach to investing by regularly reviewing these guidelines and adjusting your portfolio accordingly.
